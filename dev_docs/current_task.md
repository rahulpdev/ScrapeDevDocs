# Current Task

## Context

- **Project Scope Change:** Function 1 (Navigation Menu Sitemap Generation) has been removed. The project now focuses solely on Function 2 (URL Content Extraction and Markdown Conversion).
- Memory Bank documentation is being updated to reflect this change.
- Architecture decisions related to Function 1 are now obsolete.
- Current documentation versions (prior to this update):
  - project_brief.md: v1.0
  - codebase_summary.md: v1.5
  - tech_stack.md: v1.8
  - project_tracker.md: v1.14
  - current_task.md: v1.8

## Completed Work

### Documentation Updates

1.  **Function 1 Removal:** Updated all essential documents (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `current_task.md`, `project_tracker.md`) to remove Function 1 scope.
2.  **Image Handling Clarification:** Refined the image processing requirements in `project_brief.md` (v1.2) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.14).

### Concurrency Implementation

1. **Documentation Updates**

   - Added concurrency strategy to tech_stack.md
   - Updated codebase_summary.md with:
     - New concurrency system section
     - Updated data flow diagram
     - File locking details

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Queue-based write system for atomic operations
   - Granular file locking (fcntl) for:
     - Menu map files
     - Log files
     - Version tracking
   - Thread-per-row processing with:
     - Independent error handling
     - Automatic resource cleanup
     - No shared state between rows

## Next Steps

## Next Steps

### Function 2: Content Extractor Implementation

1.  **Input Processing:**

    - Implement logic to accept a URL (pointing to a markdown tree file) via CLI input.
    - Fetch the content from the provided URL.
    - Parse the fetched markdown content to extract the list of target URLs to crawl.
    - Validate extracted URLs.
    - Create/overwrite the `<website name>_scrape_checklist.md` file with the extracted URLs and timestamp.

2.  **Content Extraction & Conversion:**

    - Implement the core crawling logic for the extracted URLs.
    - Ensure preservation of heading hierarchy.
    - Implement image processing:
      - SVG to Mermaid conversion (using existing SVG processing logic).
      - Handling of other image formats (preserving URL, reference, alt text).
    - Implement URL replacement (relative to absolute).
    - Preserve external links.
    - Include "Last Updated" data and source URL in output files.
    - Update the corresponding checklist file upon successful processing of each URL.

3.  **Output Structure:**

    - Ensure files are saved correctly in the `<website name>_docs` folder.

4.  **SVG Processing Refinement (as part of Function 2)**
    - Finalize testing of SVG to Mermaid conversion within the context of Function 2's content extraction.
    - Ensure fallback mechanisms work correctly.

### Infrastructure Refinement

1.  **Error Handling:**

    - Ensure robust error handling covers all stages of Function 2 (input fetching/parsing, crawling, conversion, file I/O).
    - Refine logging for Function 2 specifics.

2.  **Concurrency:**
    - Verify the thread-per-URL concurrency model works effectively for Function 2.
    - Test file locking for checklist and log files under concurrent access.

### Documentation Finalization

1.  Update `project_tracker.md` to reflect the progress on Function 2 tasks.
2.  Increment version numbers for all modified Memory Bank documents upon task completion or significant changes.
3.  Update this `current_task.md` file with the next focus and new version number after completing a significant step.
