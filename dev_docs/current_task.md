# Current Task

## Context

- **Major Requirement Change:** The project requirements for handling images found on webpages have changed significantly. The previous special handling for SVG files (attempting conversion to Mermaid) is removed.
- **New Requirement:** All image links (SVG, PNG, JPG, etc.) found in `<img>` tags must be treated uniformly. The script should extract the `src` URL (converted to absolute) and `alt` text, and represent the image using the standard Markdown format `![alt text](URL)`. Image files should **not** be downloaded.
- Memory Bank documentation has been updated to reflect this change (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`).
- Current documentation versions (prior to this update):
  - project_brief.md: v1.5
  - codebase_summary.md: v1.12
  - tech_stack.md: v1.16
  - project_tracker.md: v1.39
  - current_task.md: v1.17
  - error_codes.md: v1.0

## Completed Work

### Documentation Updates

1.  **Function 1 Removal:** Updated all essential documents (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `current_task.md`, `project_tracker.md`) to remove Function 1 scope.
2.  **Image Handling Clarification:** Refined the image processing requirements in `project_brief.md` (v1.2) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.14).
3.  **Progress Bar Requirement:** Added requirement for a terminal progress bar during execution to `project_brief.md` (v1.3) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.15).

### Infrastructure Refinement

+1. **Logging Enhancements:**

- - Updated `tech_stack.md` (v1.10) with enhanced logging requirements (severity, context, taxonomy).
- - Created `error_codes.md` (v1.0) defining the error code taxonomy.
- - Updated `codebase_summary.md` (v1.7) to reference `error_codes.md`.
- - Updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.16) to reflect completion and new versions.
- +### Concurrency Implementation
-

1. **Documentation Updates**

   - Added concurrency strategy to tech_stack.md
   - Updated codebase_summary.md with:
     - New concurrency system section
     - Updated data flow diagram
     - File locking details

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Queue-based write system for atomic operations
   - Granular file locking (fcntl) for:
     - Checklist files (`<website name>_scrape_checklist.md`)
     - Log files (`<website name>_errors.log`)
   - Thread-per-URL processing with: - Independent error handling - Automatic resource cleanup - No shared state between threads/URLs
     +### Code Quality Setup

- +1. **Flake8 Configuration:**
- - Created `.flake8` file in the root directory.
- - Configured exclusions (`.venv`, `output_docs`, `tests`).
- - Configured ignored error codes (W29x, W391, E30x, E501, E2xx) as per `.clinerules/06_linting.md`.
- - Updated `tech_stack.md` (v1.14) and `project_tracker.md` (v1.26).

## Current Focus: Task Completion & Documentation Review

**Previous Phase (Implement Table Handling) is complete.** The script now uses `html2text` for conversion, correctly preserving table structures and handling UTF-8 encoding. Dependencies and relevant Memory Bank documents (`tech_stack.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `project_tracker.md`) have been updated.

**Current Activity:** Performing a final review of Memory Bank documents as requested before concluding the task.

## Next Steps

- No further implementation steps are planned for this task.
- Awaiting confirmation that Memory Bank review is complete before final sign-off.

## Memory Bank Validation Checklist (Completed for Table Handling Task)

- **project_brief.md (v1.6):**
  - [x] Verify requirements still match task (Table preservation preference).
  - [x] Check for conflicting updates (None found).
  - [x] Confirm implementation constraints (Markdown output).
- **codebase_summary.md (v1.11 -> v1.12):**
  - [x] Verify requirements still match task (Content Extractor component responsible for conversion).
  - [x] Check for conflicting updates (None found).
  - [x] Confirm implementation constraints (Uses BeautifulSoup, `html2text` now).
- **tech_stack.md (v1.15 -> v1.16):**
  - [x] Verify requirements still match task (Identifies `html2text` as current conversion tool).
  - [x] Check for conflicting updates (None found).
  - [x] Confirm implementation constraints (Python version, core libs).

## Documentation Finalization (Completed for Table Handling)

1.  `project_tracker.md` updated to mark completed table handling tasks (v1.39).
2.  Version numbers incremented for modified Memory Bank documents (`codebase_summary.md` v1.12, `tech_stack.md` v1.16, `project_tracker.md` v1.39).
3.  This `current_task.md` file updated (v1.18).
