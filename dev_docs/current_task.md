# Current Task

## Context

- **Major Requirement Change:** The project requirements for handling images found on webpages have changed significantly. The previous special handling for SVG files (attempting conversion to Mermaid) is removed.
- **New Requirement:** All image links (SVG, PNG, JPG, etc.) found in `<img>` tags must be treated uniformly. The script should extract the `src` URL (converted to absolute) and `alt` text, and represent the image using the standard Markdown format `![alt text](URL)`. Image files should **not** be downloaded.
- Memory Bank documentation has been updated to reflect this change (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`).
- Current documentation versions (prior to this update):
  - project_brief.md: v1.5
  - codebase_summary.md: v1.9
  - tech_stack.md: v1.14
  - project_tracker.md: v1.26
  - current_task.md: v1.15
  - error_codes.md: v1.0

## Completed Work

### Documentation Updates

1.  **Function 1 Removal:** Updated all essential documents (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `current_task.md`, `project_tracker.md`) to remove Function 1 scope.
2.  **Image Handling Clarification:** Refined the image processing requirements in `project_brief.md` (v1.2) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.14).
3.  **Progress Bar Requirement:** Added requirement for a terminal progress bar during execution to `project_brief.md` (v1.3) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.15).

### Infrastructure Refinement

+1. **Logging Enhancements:**

- - Updated `tech_stack.md` (v1.10) with enhanced logging requirements (severity, context, taxonomy).
- - Created `error_codes.md` (v1.0) defining the error code taxonomy.
- - Updated `codebase_summary.md` (v1.7) to reference `error_codes.md`.
- - Updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.16) to reflect completion and new versions.
- +### Concurrency Implementation
-

1. **Documentation Updates**

   - Added concurrency strategy to tech_stack.md
   - Updated codebase_summary.md with:
     - New concurrency system section
     - Updated data flow diagram
     - File locking details

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Queue-based write system for atomic operations
   - Granular file locking (fcntl) for:
     - Checklist files (`<website name>_scrape_checklist.md`)
     - Log files (`<website name>_errors.log`)
   - Thread-per-URL processing with: - Independent error handling - Automatic resource cleanup - No shared state between threads/URLs
     +### Code Quality Setup

- +1. **Flake8 Configuration:**
- - Created `.flake8` file in the root directory.
- - Configured exclusions (`.venv`, `output_docs`, `tests`).
- - Configured ignored error codes (W29x, W391, E30x, E501, E2xx) as per `.clinerules/06_linting.md`.
- - Updated `tech_stack.md` (v1.14) and `project_tracker.md` (v1.26).

## Current Focus: Refactor Image Handling

**Previous Phase (SVG Identification, Robustness Basics, Progress Bar) is complete.** The script identifies images, includes basic structured logging, implements retry logic, and displays a progress bar. However, the image handling logic needs refactoring to meet the new requirements.

The focus is now on removing the SVG-specific code paths and ensuring all images are handled uniformly using standard Markdown links.

## Next Steps: Refactoring and Completion

### 1. Refactor Image Handling Logic

- **Target:** Modify the code (`scrape_docs.py`, specifically likely within `process_single_url` or related functions) to implement the new uniform image handling.
- **Steps:**
  - **Remove SVG Logic:** Delete code related to identifying SVGs, fetching SVG content, attempting Mermaid conversion, and any associated dependencies (`Mermaid.js CLI`, `svgpathtools`, `svgwrite`, custom parser logic).
  - **Consolidate Image Handling:** Ensure the existing logic for handling non-SVG images (extracting `src`, `alt`, converting to absolute URL, creating `![alt](src)` tag) is applied to _all_ `<img>` tags encountered, regardless of the `src` file extension.
  - **Verify No Download:** Confirm that no image files (SVG or otherwise) are downloaded during processing.
  - **Dependency Cleanup:** Remove unused SVG-related dependencies from any requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, if one exists) or setup configuration.

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Target:** Update and run tests to ensure the refactored image handling works correctly.
- **Steps:**
  - **Review Existing Tests:** Examine existing tests (if any) related to image handling and update them to reflect the new requirements. Remove tests specific to SVG conversion.
  - **Add New Tests:** Create specific unit/integration tests to verify:
    - Both SVG and non-SVG image links are processed identically.
    - `src` and `alt` attributes are correctly extracted.
    - Relative `src` URLs are converted to absolute URLs.
    - The output Markdown is `![alt text](absolute URL)`.
    - No image files are downloaded.
  - **Code Quality Tools:** Run Black, Flake8 (using `.flake8` config), and Mypy. Address reported issues.

### 3. Final Refinements

- **Target:** Address remaining TODOs and enhance overall quality.
- **Steps:**
  - **Write Queue:** Implement the proper write queue with a dedicated writer thread to ensure atomic file writes, replacing the current direct write in `process_single_url`.
  - **Logging Enhancement:** Review and enhance structured logging. Remove any SVG-specific context logging. Ensure all error paths log appropriate codes from `error_codes.md`.
  - **"Last Updated" Data:** Revisit the possibility of extracting "Last Updated" data if feasible patterns are identified.
  - **Concurrency Testing:** Design and perform tests specifically targeting potential race conditions or deadlocks in the concurrent processing and checklist updates.
  - **CLI Arguments:** Add any remaining necessary command-line arguments (e.g., `--output-dir`, `--log-level`, `--num-workers`).
  - **README/CHANGELOG:** Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the removal of SVG conversion and the final state of image handling.
  - **.gitignore/.clineignore:** Ensure these files are up-to-date.

### Previous Refactoring (Completed)

1.  **Code Changes:** Modified `scrape_docs.py` to:
    - Create a root `output_docs/` directory.
    - Determine a base name from the first URL's H1 tag (or fallback to domain).
    - Create checklist files (`<base_name>_scrape_checklist.md`) within `output_docs/`.
    - Create documentation folders (`<base_name>_docs/`) within `output_docs/`.
    - Save generated markdown files into the corresponding `<base_name>_docs/` folder.
2.  **Documentation Updates:**
    - Updated `project_brief.md` (v1.5) with new output structure and `.gitignore` rule.
    - Updated `codebase_summary.md` (v1.9) with new output structure and data flow diagram.
    - Updated `.gitignore` to ignore `output_docs/`.
    - Updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.26) to mark refactoring complete and update versions.
    - Updated this `current_task.md` file (v1.15).
