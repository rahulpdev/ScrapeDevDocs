# Current Task

## Context

- **Project Scope Change:** Function 1 (Navigation Menu Sitemap Generation) has been removed. The project now focuses solely on Function 2 (URL Content Extraction and Markdown Conversion).
- Memory Bank documentation is being updated to reflect this change.
- Architecture decisions related to Function 1 are now obsolete.
- Current documentation versions (prior to this update):
  - project_brief.md: v1.3
  - codebase_summary.md: v1.7
  - tech_stack.md: v1.10
  - project_tracker.md: v1.17
  - current_task.md: v1.10
  - error_codes.md: v1.0

## Completed Work

### Documentation Updates

1.  **Function 1 Removal:** Updated all essential documents (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `current_task.md`, `project_tracker.md`) to remove Function 1 scope.
2.  **Image Handling Clarification:** Refined the image processing requirements in `project_brief.md` (v1.2) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.14).
3.  **Progress Bar Requirement:** Added requirement for a terminal progress bar during execution to `project_brief.md` (v1.3) and updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.15).

### Infrastructure Refinement

+1. **Logging Enhancements:**

- - Updated `tech_stack.md` (v1.10) with enhanced logging requirements (severity, context, taxonomy).
- - Created `error_codes.md` (v1.0) defining the error code taxonomy.
- - Updated `codebase_summary.md` (v1.7) to reference `error_codes.md`.
- - Updated `project_tracker.md` (v1.16) to reflect completion and new versions.
- +### Concurrency Implementation
-

1. **Documentation Updates**

   - Added concurrency strategy to tech_stack.md
   - Updated codebase_summary.md with:
     - New concurrency system section
     - Updated data flow diagram
     - File locking details

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Queue-based write system for atomic operations
   - Granular file locking (fcntl) for:
     - Checklist files (`<website name>_scrape_checklist.md`)
     - Log files (`<website name>_errors.log`)
   - Thread-per-URL processing with:
     - Independent error handling
     - Automatic resource cleanup
     - No shared state between threads/URLs

## Current Focus: Transition to Implementation

The design and documentation phase is complete. The project is now transitioning to the implementation phase, focusing on building Function 2 (Content Extractor).

## Next Steps: Implementation Phase 1

### 1. Core Script Structure & Input Processing

- **Setup:**
  - Create the main Python script file (e.g., `scrape_docs.py`).
  - Initialize basic logging configuration using the structured JSON format defined in `tech_stack.md` and `error_codes.md`.
  - Set up basic argument parsing (using `argparse`) to accept the input markdown tree URL.
- **Input Fetching & Parsing:**
  - Implement logic to fetch content from the provided URL using `requests`. Include error handling (network errors, invalid URL).
  - Implement logic to parse the fetched markdown content using the `markdown` library to extract the list of target URLs. Include error handling (parsing errors).
  - Implement validation for extracted URLs (basic format check).
- **Checklist Generation:**
  - Implement logic to derive `<website name>` from the input URL (e.g., based on domain).
  - Create/overwrite the `<website name>_scrape_checklist.md` file with the extracted URLs as a markdown checklist. Include error handling (file I/O).

### 2. Foundational Content Extraction (Single URL)

- **Target:** Implement the basic crawl and markdown generation for a _single_ URL first, without concurrency or complex image handling initially.
- **Steps:**
  - Fetch HTML content for a sample target URL.
  - Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup.
  - Extract and preserve heading hierarchy.
  - Implement basic relative-to-absolute URL conversion for links.
  - Preserve external links.
  - Add source URL to the end of the content.
  - Save the output to a corresponding file in the `<website name>_docs` folder (ensure folder creation).

### Documentation Finalization (Post Phase 1)

1.  Update `project_tracker.md` to mark completed Phase 1 tasks.
2.  Increment version numbers for all modified Memory Bank documents upon task completion or significant changes.
3.  Update this `current_task.md` file (v1.12) with the next implementation focus (e.g., Concurrency, Full Image Processing) and new version number after completing Phase 1.
